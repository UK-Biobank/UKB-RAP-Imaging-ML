# Imaging and Machine Learning Analyses on UKB-RAP

This repository provides tools, workflows, and tutorials for analysing UK Biobank imaging and accelerometry data on the Research Analysis Platform (RAP). It brings together and builds upon tools and pipelines developed by researchers to process imaging datasets and derive relevant variables. The resource is designed to support scalable, reproducible analysis and will continue to grow as new methods and materials are added.

## Content 

**stepcount-applet:** Example material demonstrating how to run the stepcount applet developed by OxWearables on the RAP.
- It includes a step-by-step guide for running the applet efficiently across large numbers of files.
- The strategy presented is scalable and generalisable, and can be adapted for other applets and bulk file processing tasks on the RAP.



## Status

This repository is under active development. We are continuously adding new material and refining existing workflows. Stay tuned for updates as we expand the toolkit and documentation.

If you have suggestions or are interested in a particular tool or task, we welcome your input, please share your thoughts!
